identify the one you think is most appropriate and explain why you think this is.

names the pattern and explains why you chose it

Identify a pattern:
State Pattern

Why?
The second pattern I decided to implement was the State Pattern. After comparing the alternative patterns from the textbook, I believe that the State Pattern is most useful for this code due to its focus on functionality and flexibility and efficiency which are all core factors for this specific code. The State pattern allows for flexibility and functionality via the usage of encapsulation and enums, two types of coding functions which allow code to heard off unecessary data in order to make code run to swap between states more efficiently. As the code regularly requires swapping between different actors and menus, a pattern that increases and enhances the flexibility and functionality of these transitions is crucial to improving the code condition. By implemeting encapsulation and enums, the code uses these to quickly transition between the different actors and their states and increases its runtime and functionality, thus overall benefiting the code.






<!-- -Allows us to create a system that disables functionality when not in use
    -> Code is more efficient since functionality is removed when another method is call -->
    <!-- -> Doesn't have to check everything at once -->

<!-- 
-Uses encapsulation to heard off data, efficiency is increased due to functionality being removed which allows for more efficient run time due to functionality no longer exisitng when switch pattern is active

-Using enums = easiest way to encapsulate, accompanies switch statement and is what allows us to create the state -->
